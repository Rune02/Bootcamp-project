      <p> I had done a little programming back in my sixth form but it was mainly python and with covid I did not really pay attention
          to what was being thought so with this bootcamp I feel much more at ease as there is still time for me to learn from scratch.</p>

    <p>
	My first programming project, concluding the 2 week Programming Bootcamp at 
  City (2021). This Processing project demonstrates a somewhat limit understanding of Arrays and creating interactive programs, I did use alot of help from videos and websites but also learnt a great amount through trial and error.
